# core-ts

## Purpose

Common TypeScript utils, helpers, and types. No Vue dependency; this package is framework-agnostic and provides shared type utilities (e.g. ExtractStrict, OmitStrict, FunctionAny, FunctionAnyPromise) and runtime helpers for the Colada monorepo. Add implementations in [src/types/](./src/types/).
