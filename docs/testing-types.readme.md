# Testing types

## Purpose

Type tests ensure the library’s typings (e.g. defineColadaStructure, defineColadaState, defineColadaStore, defineColadaComposable) are correct at the call site. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for repo rules and [Vitest testing types](https://vitest.dev/guide/testing-types) for the test API.

## Rule: assert only on types from the API

Assert only on types that flow from **calling** the exported APIs: return types, `useComposable()` result, instance keys. Do **not** assert on standalone fixture types (e.g. a hand-written definition type) that are unrelated to the library’s return types. Goal: verify that the library’s typings come through when implementing.

## Where

- **Files:** Vitest type tests live in `*.test-d.ts` (e.g. [packages/colada-store/src/define-colada-state.test-d.ts](../packages/colada-store/src/define-colada-state.test-d.ts)).
- **Run:** `pnpm test` from root or from the package; typecheck is included via `--typecheck`.
