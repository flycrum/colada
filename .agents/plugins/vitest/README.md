# Vitest plugin

## Purpose

Vitest type-testing guidance for the Colada monorepo: assert only on types from the API, \*.test-d.ts files, run pnpm test. See rules/ for condensed agent-facing content.

This doc may be slightly redundant with other docs. AI agents can and perhaps should stop reading here and focus on this plugin's agent-facing docs (e.g. [rules/](./rules/), [skills/](./skills/)).
