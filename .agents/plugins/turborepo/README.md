# Turborepo plugin

## Purpose

Turborepo and pnpm guidance for the Colada monorepo: orchestration, dependencies, creating new workspaces. See rules/ for condensed agent-facing content.

This doc may be slightly redundant with other docs. AI agents can and perhaps should stop reading here and focus on this plugin's agent-facing docs (e.g. [rules/](./rules/), [commands/](./commands/), [skills/](./skills/)).
